# EXPLANATION
This is a custom data structure made with the following assignment instructions

Statement: Write a program to perform following operations on Link List
a) Insertion : at the beginning, at the end, at the given location in the sorted list
b) Deletion: of first node, of last node, of given item index from sorted list
c) Given a list, split it into two sub lists â€” one for the front half, and one for the back half. If the number of elements is odd, the extra element should go in the front list. So FrontBackSplit() on the list {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} should yield the two lists {2, 3, 5} and {7, 11}.
d) Given two one-way-link lists A and B (sorted or unsorted). Sort them independently and then Merge as list.
